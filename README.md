### Hi there, stranger 👋
### Quick facts

* 👋 My name is Santtu Lehtokari and I'm currently studying my bachelor degree in information technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (BBA). Starting my thesis on September.
* 🌱 I'm currently interested in subjects such as Java, React.js, React Native, Node.js but always open for learning new things. I prefer full-stack development with modern technologies.
* 🤔 Some of my work might not be presented currently publicly on this profile. I have couple of personal projects that are in wip and some old repos are hidden, because they have too junior stuff in those. However, if needed i can showcase them.
