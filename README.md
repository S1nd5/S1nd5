### Hi there, stranger 👋
### Quick facts

* 👋 My name is Santtu Lehtokari and I'm currently studying my bachelor degree in information technology at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences (BBA). This is my last Spring of doing school related course studies before starting my thesis on September.
* 🌱 I'm currently interested in subjects such as Java, React.js, React Native, Node.js but always open for learning new things. I prefer full-stack development with modern technologies.
* 💞️ I’m looking for a summer job which would start at the end of May. Ready to stay longer if my school related thesis work can be arranged suitably.
* 🤔 Some of my work might not be presented currently publicly on this profile. I'm planning to add more proof of work during this Spring, i have couple of personal projects that are in wip. If you are a recruiter wanting to see my code and this isn't enough for you, i'm ready to provide a code sample.
